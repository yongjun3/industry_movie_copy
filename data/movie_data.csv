The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However  instead he finds redemption in Christ  the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards  including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur).

The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels to provide security  and the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned  restless  and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young black man (during "Sympathy for the Devil") by one of the concert's staff security.
